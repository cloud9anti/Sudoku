# sudoku

This program checks to see if a sudoku puzzle is valid. 

sudoku first reads arrays from text files (easy, medium, expert, 12x12) that can be modified. 
These files contain both 3x3 and 4x4 sudoku puzzles. The last two are set to have an invalid result in order to show
the messages that display if a puzzle is invalid.



## Usage

```python
#on the server
python3 sudoku.py # runs sudoku

Modify any of the sudoku text files before running the program to see a valid or invalid result.

```
